Motivation and Challenges in Adopting Soil Health Practices


This repository contains the R code used in our research paper "Motivation and Challenges in Adopting Soil Health Practices," conducted by the Nebraska Healthy Soils Task Force (HSTF) and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL).

Project Overview
In 2019-20, a survey was conducted to learn about producers' motivation and challenges in cover crop (CC), nutrient, and other soil health management practices across seven locations in Nebraska. The survey was completed by 275 participants, including producers, landowners, crop consultants, university staff, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and state agencies, and other attendees.

This research primarily focused on the following areas:

Motivation for Soil Health Practices: The most significant motivating factor in adopting soil health management practices was reducing topsoil erosion. Increasing soil water infiltration, organic matter, soil C, and the stewardship to sustain soil resources for future generations were other significant reasons.

Challenges in Cover Crop Adoption: The most significant challenge in adopting CC was a narrow window between the main crop harvest and CC planting. Input costs, including seeding, weather issues, and farm labor were also ranked high among difficulties for adopting CC.

Fertility Management: Adding legumes (soybean, alfalfa) to the rotation and manure application were the most important factors in determining NPK rates.
