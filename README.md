Motivation and Challenges in Adopting Soil Health Practices
This repository contains the R code used in our research paper "Motivation and Challenges in Adopting Soil Health Practices," conducted by the Nebraska Healthy Soils Task Force (HSTF) and the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln (UNL). The paper was published in the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation and can be found here: JSWC Online.

üéØ Project Overview
In 2019-20, a survey was conducted to gain insights about producers' motivation and challenges in cover crop (CC), nutrient, and other soil health management practices across seven locations in Nebraska. The survey garnered 275 responses from producers, landowners, crop consultants, university staff, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and state agencies, and other attendees.

The research primarily focused on the following areas:

Motivation for Soil Health Practices: The most significant motivating factor in adopting soil health management practices was reducing topsoil erosion. Other prominent reasons included increasing soil water infiltration, organic matter, soil C, and the stewardship to sustain soil resources for future generations.

Challenges in Cover Crop Adoption: A narrow window between the main crop harvest and CC planting emerged as the most significant challenge in adopting CC. Input costs, including seeding, weather issues, and farm labor were also ranked high among difficulties for adopting CC.

Fertility Management: Incorporating legumes (soybean, alfalfa) into the rotation and manure application were the key factors in determining NPK rates.
